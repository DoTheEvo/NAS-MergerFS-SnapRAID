A **NAS** that offers:

  * **Mixing** HDDs of various sizes.
  * Trivial to **add** more storage at any time.
  * One **parity drive** protects all data drives.
  * Free and **open source**.

But:
  
  * It's **more work** than just spinnig TrueNAS or OMV.<br>
    Though steps alone are simple, straightforward, but overal it's still a lot.
  * Requires solid **knowledge** of linux and the terminal.
  * SnapRAID **isn't realtime**.<br>
    Can recover dead disk only to the state from the last snapraid sync run,
    usually every 24h, and only if the data on the other drives did not change much.
  * Bad for **freqently changed** data, or millions of small files.<br>
    But that means ideal for media - Movies, Shows, Music, Photos, Audiobooks,...

### Chapters:

* Linux and disks preparation
* MergerFS - merge disks in to one mount point
* SnapRAID - adding a parity drive to prevent data loss on a disk failure
* Sharing the storage - SMB, NFS, iSCSI
* Spinning down the HDDs

# Linux and disks preparation

![linux-distros](https://i.imgur.com/fUUP3VA.png)

Have a linux installed on a machine.<br>
I use Arch, installing it using archinstall,
and have [an ansible playbooks](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/ansible-arch)
to set it up how I like it.

Now format and partition disks and mount them using fstab.

* Create a new partition **table** on each disk.<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdb --script mklabel gpt`<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt`<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdd --script mklabel gpt`<br>
* **Partition** disks.<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdb --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%`<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%`<br>
  `sudo parted /dev/sdd --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%`<br>
* **Format** the partitions and label them.<br>
  `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 -L disk_1`<br>
  `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1 -L disk_2`<br>
  `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd1 -L disk_3`<br>
* Create **directories** where drives will be mounted.<br>
  `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disk_1 /mnt/disk_2 /mnt/disk_3`
* Edit **fstab** to mount drives.<br>
  To make things easier, hereâ€™s a script that **generates the fstab entries**.
  <details>
  <summary><h5>disks-fstab-entries.sh</h5></summary>

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # Generates a nicely formatted fstab for ext4 partitions and a MergerFS pool
  # Includes size and serial number for reference

  echo "# ======================================================"
  echo "# Individual disks"
  echo "# ======================================================"
  echo

  # Loop over all partitions with ext4
  lsblk -ln -o NAME,UUID,FSTYPE,SIZE,PKNAME | while read name uuid fstype size pkname; do
      if [ "$fstype" = "ext4" ]; then
          serial=$(lsblk -dn -o SERIAL /dev/$pkname 2>/dev/null)
          echo "# $name ($size, SN: ${serial:-unknown})"
          echo "UUID=$uuid /mnt/disk_X $fstype defaults,nofail,errors=remount-ro 0 2"
          echo
      fi
  done

  echo "# ======================================================"
  echo "# MergerFS pool combining the above disks"
  echo "# ======================================================"
  echo
  echo "# /mnt/disk_* /mnt/pool fuse.mergerfs defaults,category.create=pfrd,func.getattr=newest,minfreespace=20G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0"
  ```

  </details>

  It includes the size and the serial number of the disks,
  as well as a commented out mergerfs section that can be used later.
  * Make the script executable: `chmod +x disks-fstab-entries.sh`
  * Run it: `./disks-fstab-entries.sh`<br>
    It echoes stuff into the terminal for you to copy/paste into fstab.
  * Remove the lines you dont want, **edit the mount points** as needed
  since they all are set to `/mnt/disk_X` 

To mount all disks definied in fstab - `sudo mount -a` or just reboot.<br>
Check if all is fine with `lsblk` and `lsblk -f` and `duf` or `dysk`.

# MergerFS

![fstab-pic](https://i.imgur.com/bKhC1zT.png)

* [Github](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs)
* [The documentation.](https://trapexit.github.io/mergerfs/)

Merges disks of various sizes in to one pool.<br>

* Files are just simply spread across the disks and are **plainly accessible**
  even if a disk would be pulled out and placed in an another machine.
* Think of it as a **virtual mount point**, not a filesystem.
* Works at the **file level**, as oppose to the block level, and uses **fuse**
  in **user space**, as oppose to be living in the kernel space.
* There is **NO redundancy**, MergerFS is all about just merging disk space.<br>
  That's why we use SnapRAID later.
* Simple setup and configuration with a single line in `/etc/fstab`
* Easy to add drives, no rebuild time.
* Written in C++ and C.

### MergerFS setup

All your disks are formated, mounted and ready.

* Install mergerfs<br>
  `yay mergerfs`
* Create a directory for the merged mount point.<br>
  `sudo mkdir /mnt/pool`<br>
* edit the fstab, add mergerfs mount definition.<br>
  The `disk_*` is a wildcard that catches all desired disks mounts.
  ```
  /mnt/disk_* /mnt/pool fuse.mergerfs defaults,category.create=pfrd,func.getattr=newest,minfreespace=20G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0
  ```
* Mount it.<br>
  `sudo mount /mnt/pool`
* Take ownership of the new mount `sudo chown $USER:$USER /mnt/pool`<br>

<details>
<summary><h3>MergerFS policies</h3></summary>

* [The official docs](https://trapexit.github.io/mergerfs/latest/config/functions_categories_policies/)

A major aspect of mergerfs is picking the policy that decides **how the data
are spread** across the drives. 
Reading the official documentation is a **must do**, but to give some idea...

Two types

  * **path preserving** - the top directory anchors everything to a specific
    drive. Side effect is that if a disk gets full the new write in to
    that directory fails. You you can also use one of the less strict
    path preserving polices, the ones starting with `msp...` that will
    start putting stuff to another drive instead of failing.
  * **not path preserving** - data go to a disk with the most free space,
    or with the least used space, or disk is picked randomly,
    or some variation. The directories structure plays no role.

The **default** policy is `pfrd` which is **not** path preserving.<br>
Picks disk randomly, but the available free space affects the odds.

#### Mixing policies

MergerFS offers fine control over policies and one can have different policy
for directories and for files. 

```
/mnt/disk_* /mnt/pool fuse.mergerfs defaults,func.create=eppfrd,func.mkdir=pfrd,func.getattr=newest,minfreespace=20G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0
```

* `func.create=msppfrd` - path preserving for files
* `func.mkdir=pfrd` - directories are spread randomly

Kinda like the idea of having stuff grouped by a directory, but not all the way
to the top, just the parent directory. Meaning that files that are together
in the same directory end up on the same disk, but directories themselves
are spread around.<br>
Feels like this makes the best use of the aspect of mergerfs where you
get to keep the data on surviving drives after a failure.<br>
But it kinda depends on the type of data you have.

  * Shows, music, audiobooks,... benefit from this appraoch as just
    having some of the files of a season, or audiobok or an album same
    as not having them at all.
  * Photos, documents,.. here this appraoch might be worse, as a disk failure
    loses you entire year of photos or an entire vacation because photos were
    in a directory titled "2019" and "Vacation Iceland". Which might
    be worse than having at least some of them because they were
    spread across drives.

# SnapRAID

* [Github](https://github.com/amadvance/snapraid)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/amadvance/snapraid/blob/master/HISTORY)
* [The documentation.](https://www.snapraid.it/manual)
* [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SnapRAID)

Provides protection against disk failure and bitrot.<br> 
Works at file level, not disk or block level. Unlike regular raid that is
constant, snapraid needs to have scheduled syncs. Usually once every 24 hours.<br>
In case of a disk failure, you are able to recover data from the last sync run,
but only if the data on the other drives didn't change much as parity is
counted against content of all data drives.<br>
This behavior makes it good only for data that do not change much,
so it's popular for media servers - Good for media storage - 
Movies, Shows, Music, Photos, Audiobooks,...

### SnapRAID setup

* install snapraid<br>
  `yay snapraid`
* Create `/etc/snapraid.conf`
  ```bash
  # Parity file - disk
  parity /mnt/parity/snapraid.parity

  # Data disks, the order matters!
  disk disk_1 /mnt/disk_1
  disk disk_2 /mnt/disk_2
  disk disk_3 /mnt/disk_3

  # Content file with metadata for recovery
  content /var/lib/snapraid.content
  content /mnt/disk_1/snapraid.content
  content /mnt/disk_2/snapraid.content
  content /mnt/disk_3/snapraid.content

  # Excludes
  exclude /lost+found/
  exclude .Trash-*/
  exclude .recycle/

  # autosave every 100GB
  autosave 100
  ```
* `sudo snapraid sync` - the first initial sync

### SnapRAID Automation

* create a file `/opt/snapraid-sync-run-maint.sh`<br>
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  set -euo pipefail

  LOG="/var/log/snapraid.log"
  exec >> "$LOG" 2>&1

  echo "=== SnapRAID job started at $(date) ==="

  # 1. Daily sync (skip files modified in last 30 min)
  /usr/bin/snapraid sync

  # 2. Monthly partial scrub (10%) on the 1st
  if [[ $(date +%d) -eq 01 ]]; then
      /usr/bin/snapraid scrub -p 10
  fi

  # 3. SMART check on the 1st of each month
  if [[ $(date +%d) -eq 15 ]]; then
      echo "--- SMART check ---"
      for disk in /dev/sd?; do
          echo "SMART for $disk"
          /usr/bin/smartctl -H "$disk"
      done
  fi

  echo "=== SnapRAID job finished at $(date) ==="
  ```

* Make it executable `sudo chmod +x /opt/snapraid-sync-run-maint.sh`
* create a systemd unit and a timer files.

  `/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-sync-run-maint.service`
  ```bash
  [Unit]
  Description=SnapRAID sync, scrub, smart

  [Service]
  Type=oneshot
  ExecStart=/opt/snapraid-sync-run-maint.sh
  ```

  `/etc/systemd/system/snapraid-sync-run-maint.timer`
  ```bash
  [Unit]
  Description=Run SnapRAID sync, scrub, smart,... nightly at 01:30

  [Timer]
  OnCalendar=*-*-* 01:30:00
  Persistent=true

  [Install]
  WantedBy=timers.target
  ```

* enable the timer<br>
  `sudo systemctl enable --now snapraid-sync-run-maint.timer.timer`

<details>
<summary><h4>Logrotate</h4></summary>

To prevent growth of the log file.

* install `logrotate`
* create a config file<br>
  `/etc/logrotate.d/snapraid`
  ```bash
  /var/log/snapraid.log {
      size 20M
      rotate 1
      missingok
      notifempty
      create
  }
  ```
Can do dry run to see what it would do `sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf`

<details>
<summary><h4>SnapRAID Notifications</h4></summary>

I use [ntfy](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/selfhosted-apps-docker/tree/master/gotify-ntfy-signal)
for push notifications.<br>
Create a new systemd unit file that will send the notification
to your ntfy server.

`/etc/systemd/system/ntfy@.service`
```bash
[Unit]
Description=ntfy notification service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/curl --fail --retry 3 --retry-delay 30 -d "%i | %H" https://ntfy.example.com/snapraid
```

Edit the snapraid unit file, adding OnFailure and OnSuccess actions.

`snapraid-sync-run-maint.service`
```bash
[Unit]
Description=SnapRAID sync, scrub, smart
OnFailure=ntfy@failure-%p.service
OnSuccess=ntfy@success-%p.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/opt/snapraid-sync-run-maint.sh

<summary><h1>Spinning down the HDDs</h1></summary>

![spindown-gif](https://i.imgur.com/QrhQWQc.gif)

Saves \~3W of power per disk, heat, wear and noise,... but the first time
accessing the storage takes \~10 seconds..<br>
Disks might or might not spindown on their own on idle.
Most distros don't force it, but the firmware preset of the disks might.

If you want to **take control** [hdparm](https://linux.die.net/man/8/hdparm)
can change power saving and idle time.

* `sudo hdparm -B ...` -  controls APM power saving in drives firmware
* `sudo hdparm -S ...` - controls idle standby timer in drives firmware

The execution does not survive reboot so systemd service is used to
apply prefered behaviour on boot.

### Prevent spindown 

`/etc/systemd/system/hdds-spindown-prevent.service`
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Prevent spindown for all HDDs
After=local-fs.target systemd-udev-settle.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'for d in /sys/block/sd*; do [ -f "$d/queue/rotational" ] && [ "$(cat $d/queue/rotational)" -eq 1 ] && [ -b "/dev/$(basename $d)" ] && /usr/bin/hdparm -S 0 -B 255 /dev/$(basename $d) 2>/dev/null || true; done'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable the service<br>
`sudo systemctl enable --now hdds-spindown-prevent.service`

### Control spindown 

`/etc/systemd/system/hdds-spindown-enabled.service`
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Enable spindown for all HDDs after 2 hours idle
After=local-fs.target systemd-udev-settle.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'for d in /sys/block/sd*; do [ -f "$d/queue/rotational" ] && [ "$(cat $d/queue/rotational)" -eq 1 ] && [ -b "/dev/$(basename $d)" ] && /usr/bin/hdparm -S 244 -B 127 /dev/$(basename $d) 2>/dev/null || true; done'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable the service<br>
`sudo systemctl enable --now hdds-spindown-enabled.service`

The 2 hours is set by `hdparm -S 244`,
hdparm uses bit weird [time system](https://linux.die.net/man/8/hdparm).

  * 1 - 240 is multiplies of 5 seconds. So 60 is 5 minutes.
  * 241 - 251 is multiplies of 30 minutes. So 241=30m, 242=60m, 243=90m,...

As for the `hdparm -B 127` - the APM range is 1 - 254.
Lower the number more aggresive power savings.
The 127 value is a moderate balanced level that will not be more aggresive
than the desired 2 hours.

---

Be aware, freshly formated ext4 disks finish their initialization
in the background. Kernel runs `ext4lazyinit` process that zeroes inodes
and disks can be heard chirping and doing something even when there should be
no activity. Though also disks firmware might be doing stuff on its own occasionally.

* A command showing the spindown state of every drive:<br>
  `for d in /dev/sd[a-z]; do echo -n "$d: "; sudo hdparm -C "$d" | grep state; done`
* See disks activity:<br>
  `sudo iotop -ao`<br>
  `sudo blktrace -d /dev/sdd -o - | blkparse -i -`

### Monitoring spindowns and spinups

To have degree of certanty that disks are not spinning down and up
400 times a day, hastening their demise.

* Create the log script in `/opt/disks-spin-logger.sh`<br>
  <details>
  <summary><h5>disks-spin-logger.sh</h5></summary>
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  LOGFILE="/var/log/disks-spin.log"
  STATEFILE="/var/lib/disks-spin.state"
  SUMMARY="/var/log/disks-spin-summary.log"
  DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
  DAY=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

  mkdir -p /var/lib

  for dev in /dev/sd[a-z]; do
      CURR_STATE=$(hdparm -C "$dev" 2>/dev/null | awk '/drive state/ {print $NF}')
      [[ -z "$CURR_STATE" ]] && continue  # skip if no result

      PREV_STATE=$(awk -v d="$dev" '$1==d {print $2}' "$STATEFILE" 2>/dev/null)

      if [[ "$CURR_STATE" != "$PREV_STATE" ]]; then
          echo "$DATE $dev $CURR_STATE" >> "$LOGFILE"

          # count spinups / spindowns
          case "$CURR_STATE" in
              active*|idle*)  # matches "active", "active/idle", "idle"
                  EVENT="SPINUP"
                  ;;
              standby)
                  EVENT="SPINDOWN"
                  ;;
              *)
                  EVENT=""
                  ;;
          esac

          if [[ -n "$EVENT" ]]; then
              # Update summary: device + day + counters
              awk -v dev="$dev" -v day="$DAY" -v event="$EVENT" '
                  BEGIN {found=0}
                  {
                      if ($1==day && $2==dev) {
                          if (event=="SPINUP")   $3++
                          if (event=="SPINDOWN") $4++
                          found=1
                      }
                      print
                  }
                  END {
                      if (!found) {
                          up=(event=="SPINUP")?1:0
                          down=(event=="SPINDOWN")?1:0
                          print day, dev, up, down
                      }
                  }
              ' "$SUMMARY" 2>/dev/null > "$SUMMARY.tmp"
              mv "$SUMMARY.tmp" "$SUMMARY"

              if ! grep -q "^DATE" "$SUMMARY"; then
                  sed -i '1iDATE DEVICE SPINUPS SPINDOWNS' "$SUMMARY"
              fi

          fi

          # update state file
          grep -v "^$dev " "$STATEFILE" 2>/dev/null > "$STATEFILE.tmp"
          echo "$dev $CURR_STATE" >> "$STATEFILE.tmp"
          mv "$STATEFILE.tmp" "$STATEFILE"
      fi
  done
  ```
* Make the script executable: `sudo chmod +x /opt/disks-spin-logger.sh`
* create a systemd unit file and a timer file in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

  `disks-spin-logger.service`
  ```bash
  [Unit]
  Description=Log disks spin state

  [Service]
  Type=oneshot
  ExecStart=/opt/disks-spin-logger.sh
  ```

  `disks-spin-logger.timer`
  ```bash
  [Unit]
  Description=Run disks spin logger periodically

  [Timer]
  OnBootSec=1min
  OnUnitActiveSec=5min
  AccuracySec=10s
  Persistent=true

  [Install]
  WantedBy=timers.target
  ```

* enable the timer<br>
  `sudo systemctl enable --now disks-spin-logger.timer`

The log files will be in `/var/log/`

  * `disks-spin.log` - state of every disk at the check interval.
  * `disks-spin-summary.log` - total number of spin downs and ups per day

#### logrotate

To prevent growth of the log files.

* install `logrotate`
* create a config file<br>
  `/etc/logrotate.d/disks-spin`
  ```bash
  /var/log/disks-spin*.log {
      size 20M
      rotate 1
      missingok
      notifempty
      create
  }
  ```
Can do dry run to see what it would do `sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf`
